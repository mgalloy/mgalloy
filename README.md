#### About me

I'm a software developer focusing on high-performance computing and visualization in scientific programming. I work mostly in IDL, but occasionally use C, CUDA, Python, bash scripting, etc.

I am currently a Software Engineer/Programmer at NCAR. I work on data from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) in the High Altitude Onservatory (HAO). I write the calibration pipelines for the MLSO instruments:

1. [K-Cor pipeline][kcor-pipeline] ([utilities][kcor-utilities]) (COronal Solar Magnetism Observatory (COSMO) K-coronagraph)
2. [CoMP pipeline][comp-pipeline] ([utilities][comp-utilities]) (COronal Multi-channel Polarimeter)
3. [UCoMP pipeline][ucomp-pipeline] (Upgraded COronal Multi-channel Polarimeter)
4. [ChroMag pipeline][chromag-pipeline] (Chromosphere and Prominence Magnetometer)

Previously, I was a Research Mathematician at [Tech-X Corporation][txcorp]. My projects involved maintaining several commercial products (all IDL libraries):

1. [GPULib][gpulib] (GPU accelerated IDL code), 
2. FastDL (mpiDL and TaskDL, parallel processing from within IDL), and 
3. the Remote Data Toolkit (easy to use OPeNDAP and netCDF bindings).

I also maintain and develop several open source projects in IDL. The most used are:

1. [IDLdoc] (a utility for generating documentation from IDL source code),
2. [mgunit] (a unit testing framework for IDL), and
3. [rIDL] (a enhanced command line interface to IDL).

A few years ago, I wrote a book, [Modern IDL][modernidl]. It covers beginning through advanced topics in using IDL, including direct graphics, object-oriented programming, object graphics, and other techniques to get the most out of IDL. See the [Modern IDL website][modernidl] website to purchase, read a sample chapter, download code examples, and more.
